                    <p>"We need technology in every classroom and in every student and teacher's hand, 
                        because it is the pen and paper of our time, and it is the lens through which we experience much of our world"

                        <p>She considered the birds to be her friends. 
                            She'd put out food for them each morning and then she'd watch as 
                            they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day. 
                            She wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her. 
                            Would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning?</p>

                    <p>I've always been fascinated by how things work. My journey into programming started a few years ago when I decided to learn Python. Since then, I've explored various programming languages and technologies.</p>
                    <p>"The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it." 
                        <b>~Dennis Ritchie.</b> </p>

                    <p>Programming has opened up a world of possibilities for me, allowing me to 
                        create solutions and bring ideas to life. I'm excited to continue this journey 
                        and share my experiences with you all.</p>
